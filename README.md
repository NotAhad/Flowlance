## Overview

Freelancer Dashboard simulates a real-world freelancer management system. The application allows users to view and manage:

- **Projects:** A list of active projects with details and interactive visualizations (using Chart.js).
- **Clients:** Client data is presented in a responsive data table with action buttons for viewing detailed client profiles.
- **Finances:** Financial data and analytics for tracking revenue and outstanding payments.
- **Tasks:** An interactive Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality for managing project tasks.

The project leverages:

- **React Hooks & TypeScript:** For robust state management and type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For a modern, responsive, and utility-first design.
- **Material UI & Chart.js:** To render data tables and visualizations.
- **Custom Drag-and-Drop Logic:** For an intuitive Kanban board experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Visualizations:** Integrated Chart.js charts to provide insights into project and financial data.
- **Kanban Board:** Custom drag-and-drop interface to manage project tasks.
- **Responsive Data Tables:** Material UI DataGrid for clean and structured client and project lists.
- **Dynamic Modals:** Reusable modal component for adding new clients or projects.
- **Modern & Responsive UI:** Fully responsive design built with Tailwind CSS.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```jsx
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowlance.git
   cd flowlance

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

   ```jsx
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   ```jsx
   npm start
   ```

   This command starts the development server. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.

## Usage

**Navigation:**

- **The application features a sidebar menu and a top navigation bar. Users can switch between dashboards for projects, clients, finances, and tasks.**

**Viewing Data:**

- **The main dashboard displays interactive charts and data tables. For example, clicking on a row in the client table navigates to a detailed client page.**

**Managing Tasks:**

- **Use the Kanban board to drag and drop task cards between columns. This interface updates the task status dynamically.**

**Adding New Items:**

- **Click the “Add New” button (found on the Clients or Projects pages) to open a modal form. The form is dynamically generated based on the provided field definitions.**

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Dynamic Modal Form Generation

**Challenge:**
Generating a form dynamically based on column definitions while excluding non-editable fields.

**Solution:**
The modal component filters out fields like "id" and "img" from the provided columns and maps over the rest to create input fields.

### 2. State Management & Type Safety

**Challenge:**
Ensuring data consistency across various components (clients, projects, tasks) and reducing runtime errors.

**Solution:**
Using React hooks with TypeScript provides clear type definitions and robust state management, helping to catch errors during development.

### 3. Implementing Custom Drag-and-Drop

**Challenge:**
Developing a smooth drag-and-drop interface for the Kanban board without relying on external libraries.

**Solution:**
The project leverages native drag events (e.g., onDragStart, onDrop) and updates state accordingly to reflect task status changes.

### 4. Responsive Design and UI Consistency

**Challenge:**
Maintaining a consistent look and feel across different screen sizes.

**Solution:**
Tailwind CSS utility classes and responsive design techniques are used throughout the project to ensure a seamless experience on any device.

## Future Improvements

**Enhanced Accessibility:**
Further improve accessibility by adding ARIA attributes and better keyboard navigation support.

**Performance Optimizations:**
Implement memoization (using useMemo/useCallback) and consider code splitting for performance improvements.

**Backend Integration:**
Replace local storage with a backend API to enable real-time data persistence and multi-user support.

**Advanced Animations:**
Integrate animation libraries (e.g., Framer Motion or GSAP) for smoother transitions and interactive feedback.

**Testing:**
Add unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and maintainability of the codebase.
